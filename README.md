## Online Book Library
This project is a web application for an online book library built with Next.js and Redux. 
It allows users to browse a collection of books, search for books by title or author, 
filter books by genre, and view additional details about each book.

## Site Architecture
The application is primarily built with Next.js for the frontend and utilizes Redux for global state management. 
The architecture is designed to be lightweight, with a clear separation between UI logic and data handling.

## Frontend
Next.js: Serves as the primary framework for building the application.
Redux: Used to manage the application's global state, facilitating communication between components.
Tailwind CSS: Adopted for rapid and responsive styling of components.

## API Usage
The application consumes the https://example-data.draftbit.com/books API to retrieve the list of books.
This API provides a dataset comprising the title, author, description, genre, and cover image for each book.
